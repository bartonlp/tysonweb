<p>Downtown New Bern is, in my humble opinion, the finest historic district in North Carolina, and perhaps one of the finest small city historic districts in the nation. It is adorned with many beautiful historic homes and buildings some dating back to the late 1700's. The revitalization of the downtown business district and the residential area is one of the great success stories in N.C. urban renewal projects. For information on the downtown transformation click this link <a href="http://www.downtownnewbern.com/index.htm" target="_blank"><b>Swiss Bear Downtown Development</b></a></p>

<p>In the last few years more and more folks, especially retirees, are expressing interest in living in a small historic downtown neighborhood. Some of the amenities on their wish list include,

<ul>
    <li>Sidewalks for biking and walking.</li>
    <li>Restaurants within walking distance.</li>
    <li>City park within walking distance.</li>
    <li>Public library within walking distance. </li>
    <li>Coffee shops. </li>
    <li>Arts and entertainment</li>

<p>Living downtown will allow you to park your car and reap the benefits of a healthy dose of walking or biking. On any given day you will find dozens of folks walking their dog, working in their gardens, and just sitting on their front porch reading a book and enjoying life. Many of the retirees are active in the many non profits in the community. Trust me, you can stay as active as you want here volunteering for one of the many fine non profits.</p>

<p>The town of New Bern was founded in 1710 by an English explorer, John Lawson, and a Swiss entrepreneur, Baron Degraffinreid. It served as the Colonial Capital of N.C. and was the first Capital of N.C. after we won our Independance from England. To learn more about the history of New Bern, click the link below.</p>

<p>Downtown is alive with fashionable shops, 13 restaurants, The Historic Tryon Palace, The N.C. History Museum, art shops, antiques shops, crafts and clothing shops, gourmet coffee shops, and several excellent civic theaters. Union Point Park has a public boat ramp, fishing docks, day boat slips, swing sets, and restroom's. And all this is within walking distance if you live downtown.</p> 

<p>Stroll along the downtown river walk and admire some of the beautiful Hatteras Yachts which are made right here in New Bern. The Neuse and Trent Rivers converge in downtown New Bern and form the widest river in North America. The Neuse is a paradise for sailors, power boaters, fishermen, kayakers, and paddle boarders. New Bern has an incredible amount of waterways to explore. There are three nice marinas located within biking distance. Did you know New Bern was named one of the top ten waterfront retirement locations in the U.S.?</p>

<p>Historic downtown New Bern is quickly becoming known as a destination city for artist. The downtown area has a profusion of talented artist as well as several art galleries. Do you have a talent or passion for theatre? There are theatre productions going on year around. And, it's easy to get involved.</p>

Some sections are strictly for residential use. Some of the buildings in the business district have shops on the first floor and living quarters on the second.</p>


<p>In 1973 the Downtown Historic District was entered into the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
