"The Tyson Group was great to work with.  Steve knows the area inside and out and was a great help to us moving from out of town.  I highly recommend them." --John Zannis, MD

				<p><b>Walt and Ruth Doyle</b><p>
				Steve and Jana got us out of a tight when they sold our house in under a month. 
				I would recommend them to all my friends.</p>
				
				<hr>
					
				<p>Thanks for helping us find the perfect first house.</p>
					<p><b>The Hochteils</b></p>
				
				<hr>
					
					<p><b>Mary and Joey Pace</b></p>
				<p><b>Dear Jana and Steve</b></p>
				<p>I wanted to thank you for all your work in 
				helping us find our house. We are still trying to get settled in.<br>We
				welcomed Elizabeth to our family on June 26th, two days before 
				we moved. I would like to invite you and Steve anytime to stop 
				by and take a look at the kitchen now that it has been opened 
				up. We look forward to seeing you again.</p>
				
				<hr>
					
					<p><b>Mike and Rachel Fessler</b></b></p>
			<p>I am a Marine officer and recently transferred to Cherry Point. 
I needed to find a house quickly and The 
Tyson Group was very accommodating and efficient in finding a home for us that met our 
requirements.</p>
				
				<hr>
					
			<p><b>Tom and Belinda Scheber</b></font></p>
			<p>We have only words of praise to describe our 
				experience with Steve and Jana Tyson of The Tyson Group  in New Bern.&nbsp; &nbsp;We were initially charmed by New Bern during 
				our first visit to the area, but had no idea where to start 
				looking for a home or the benefits and drawbacks of each 
				area.&nbsp;Luckily, we contacted the Tyson Group and asked a few 
				questions.&nbsp; During each succeeding trip to New Bern over the 
				next eighteen months, Steve and Jana would patiently take us on 
				tours of the local area and help us learn about the many 
				different options available.&nbsp;We finally found just the house 
				that we had envisioned and are delighted with our new home.&nbsp; 
				&nbsp;During our previous house-buying experiences, the house closing 
				ended the willingness of a real estate agency to extend advice 
				and assistance – that was not the case with the Tyson Group.&nbsp; 
				Steve and Jana provided invaluable help and advice to us <u>
				after </u>closing and helped make our transition to our New Bern 
				&nbsp;home as smooth as possible.&nbsp; Throughout our process, the Tyson 
				Group was consistently friendly, helpful, and willing to go a 
				“step beyond” what we have previously experienced from real 
				estate professionals.</p>

			<p><b>George and Kathy Nichols</b></p>
			<p>We sold our home and bought another with the Tyson Group. 
We then bought and sold another home with them. We were completely satisfied with their service.</p>
				
				<hr>
					
					<p><b>Ron and Mollie Bowers</b></p>
			<p>We found The Tyson group online and after talking to them felt 
they had the experience to help us find the best home for us. This is our first 
purchase in over 20 years and we are delighted with the home and the service we 
received</p>
				
				<hr>
					
					<p><b>Donald Arthur</b></p>
			<p>I have known Steve Tyson for over 30 years so when I decided to 
sell a piece of commercial property I already know who to list with. In the mist 
of the worst recession since the depression he got it sold in less than 2 
months. Thank you Steve for a job well done. I would recommend you to anyone.</p>
				
				<hr>
					
			<p><b>Steve 
				and Susan Centore</b>

			extremely smooth.</p>

			<p><b>Dave Barr</b><p>

					<p>Here's how it works: You input your original mortgage balance, the original term and interest rate. 
					Then figure out how many month's of payments you've already made. Finally, decide how soon you'd like to have your mortgage paid off. 
					For example, a couple in their 40's may decide that they'd like to pay off the 30-year loan they took out last year in 20 years. 
					They input the particulars of their current loan, put in a new term of 20 years, and the Early Payoff Calculator determines how much extra they need 
					to pay each month to make that happen.
