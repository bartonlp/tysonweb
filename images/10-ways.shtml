<p> 1.  <i><b>Curb appeal: </b></i>
 First impressions are lasting impressions and believe me curb appeal is very 
important. You are trying to sell your house. I have had appointments to show 
properties and my clients did not even want to go inside after seeing the junk 
in the front yard and the toilet bowl planter on the front porch.  
<img border="0" src="../images/curb%20appeal.jpg" width="133" height="100" align="left"> The first thing a prospective 
buyer will see when they drive to your house is your front yard. The second thing they see is your front porch. Make sure both are spruced up 
and will make a nice impression. Fresh potted plants go a long way and are 
not that expensive. New pine straw is not that expensive and can make a fresh 
and well kept look. A new coat of paint on the front door is always a good idea. 
How about a brand new door knob? Does your 
driveway and house need pressure washing? Definitely de-clutter your yard. These items are 
low-cost. The great thing about a good curb appeal in addition to making a good 
impression on buyers visiting the home, is that it will allow your Realtor to 
take nice photos of your home. Since many buyers see homes online before 
choosing to see the home in person, you want the best exterior photo you can 
get!  </p>

<p>  <i><b>2. Finish the honey-do 
list</b></i> :  
<img border="0" src="../images/honey_do_1074442_std.gif" width="263" height="329" align="left"> You know what the list is. The little things that you have put 
off for a long time. The broken globe on the light fixture in the hallway. The 
grinding noise the hall bath exhaust fan makes. The broken tile in front of the 
dishwasher. You may have stopped noticing these things but buyers have not. To 
them this can be perceived deferred maintenance. These relatively inexpensive items 
can make a difference. I have shown homes that had quite a few of these loose 
ends needing attention and my clients said they did not want to buy a home that&nbsp; 
required so much work even if they were little items. </p>
<p>  <i><b>3. Stage the rooms</b></i> :
Stand in the 
	doorway to find each room&#39;s 
												focal point, and use furniture 
												placement to highlight that. The 
												back of your sofa shouldn&#39;t 
												block the view of the fireplace, 
												for example, and the dining room 
												table shouldn&#39;t be<img border="0" src="../images/staging.jpg" width="126" height="91" align="right"> sharing space 
												with a stair climber. You should 
												remove any extraneous pieces of 
												furniture, but you may be able 
												to &quot;repurpose&quot; them in another 
												room. A wingback chair that&#39;s 
												crowding the family room might 
												help create a nice reading nook 
												in the master bedroom.  </p>
<p>  <i><b>4. Have a current 
Comparative Market Analysis:</b></i>  This needs to be done so you have a 
realistic value on your home. The CMA should have been done within the last 3 
months. This is 
<img border="0" src="../images/cma.jpg" width="130" height="91" align="left">a buyer&#39;s market. If your house is perceived to be overpriced by 
a potential buyer or other Real Estate Brokers it will not get shown. If it is not shown it 
will not be sold. In today&#39;s market most Real Estate Brokers would rather see a 
home priced to sell, rather than be offered a bonus for selling. </p>
<p>  <i><b>5. Have a Home Inspection 
done</b></i> : A pre-sale 
												inspection can help in several ways. 
First of all more real estate deals go south due to home inspections than 
anything else. Professional inspections can identify problems 
<img border="0" src="../images/home-inspection.jpg" width="121" height="121" align="left">that could prevent 
a sale. If you know what those problems are before there is an offer on the 
table, you have the opportunity to correct the deficiencies. And if there are no 
major problems or the problems have already been addressed, an inspection 
												can publicize that fact to 
												skittish buyers. Having an 
inspection laying out on the counter shows the potential buyer that you have nothing 
to hide. </p>
<p>  <i><b>6. De-clutter the inside 
of your house</b></i> : Too much 
												stuff makes rooms look smaller 
												and<img border="0" src="../images/declutter.jpg" width="214" height="214" align="right"> focuses buyers&#39; attention on 
												your possessions rather than the 
												home you&#39;re trying to sell. 
												That&#39;s why many professional 
												stagers recommend removing as 
												much as a third of your things 
												to better show off rooms and 
												closets. Since you&#39;re 
												going to have to pack it up 
												anyway why not go ahead and do 
it now. It is very difficult for a buyer to imagine themselves living 
												in your house if they can&#39;t 
visualize how their furniture would work. </p>
<p> <i><b> 7. Depersonalize your 
house:  </b></i>  
												&nbsp;The first items that you should 
pack as you are de-cluttering your home should be family 
												photos and other collections that say 
												&quot;you.&quot; Streamline your artwork 
												and consider toning down bold 
												decorating statements. The 20 
photos of your grandchildren on the refrigerator may have special meaning to you 
but to buyers they represent clutter. </p>
<p> <b><i> 9. Odor removal:  </i></b> 
 You don&#39;t want other Real Estate Agents to 
remember your house as the cat litter house. 
<img border="0" src="../images/stinky.jpg" width="143" height="112" align="left">I was showing a home some time ago 
and the minute we opened the front door we were overwhelmed with a smell of cat 
urine. Needless to say my customer turned around and said &quot;let&#39;s go&quot;. If you&#39;re not sure 
												how your place smells, get your 
												least tactful friend to take a 
												few whiffs and tell you the 
												honest truth. Sometimes we get 
accustomed to the scents in our own homes. </p>
<p> <i><b> 10. Pick the Right Agent: </b></i>  &nbsp; 
This most important thing you can do to sell your home will cost you nothing. 
That is, choosing your Real Estate Professional. Do this based upon their 
expertise and marketing skills. 
<img border="0" src="../images/Tyson.jpg" width="111" height="137" align="right">Friends may refer their sister-in-law or you may 
have a neighbor or a friend at church in the business, but steer clear of these 
agents unless the agent is qualified. Selling a home is one of the largest 
financial decisions a person will ever make. You do not want an inexperienced or 
&quot;discount&quot; broker handling that for you. If you were going to get an operation 
would you want a &quot;discount&quot; doctor or if you were going to trial, would you want 
an inexperienced lawyer? This is serious business, treat it as such. </p>
