					<p align="left">The Blades mansion, shown on the left, is located on 
					Johnson Street in downtown New Bern. 
					This elaborate Queen Anne House was designed by renowned architect Herbert 
					Simpson for lumber magnate William B. Blades. It combines 
					elements of Queen Anne and Greek Revival, making it one of 
					the most elegant mansions in New Bern. The Blades brothers 
					were New Bern's largest lumber barons in the early 1900's. At one time New Bern 
					had over 20 lumber mills and lumber, along with agriculture, 
					was the areas largest employer.</p> 
			<p><u><b>Downtown New Bern</b></u> 
is one of the finest historic districts in the nation with many beautiful 
historic homes dating back to the late 1700s and early 1800s, . There are the 
large and palatial ones with beautiful garden areas, there are the neat bungalows, perfectly manicured as well 
			as historic condos and town homes. Some areas of downtown are 
			multi-zoned, allowing for residential and commercial uses. The photo below was taken in the 1930's.</p>

<p >Ghent is the newest of New Bern's three historic districts. Admission 
to the National Register occurred in 1983. Ghent contains private homes built from 
			1913 to World War II. The area encompasses Spencer Avenue, Rhem 
Avenue, and parts of Park Avenue. <p>Having grown up in Ghent, I know this area 
			quite well.	</p>
<p><img border="0" align="left" src="../images/Trolley-Spencer.jpg" height="330" width=460" title="Old photo of the Spencer Avenue Trolley" alt="Spencer Avenue once had a Trolley that ran all the way to downtown New Bern.">The Ghent neighborhood was subdivided in 1906. At that time cars were not common and Ghent was considered to far out for folks to live. To make Ghent more attractive the developers built an electric trolley that ran from the end of Spencer Avenue around the business district in downtown New Bern, to the train station, out to Riverside, and back to Spencer Avenue. The photo on the left shows the trolley as it approaches Middle Street in downtown New Bern. The trolly was in operation from 1911-1929. 

<p>As an additional attraction the developers built the Ghent Casino. This was a gathering place for the residents where weddings, parties, dances, and even boxing matches took place. Looks like a wedding or big party going on when this photo was taken.</p>
<p><img border="0" align="center" src="../images/Ghent-Casino-sized.jpg" height="452" width=700" title="Ghent Casino was New Bern's place to party in the roaring 20's" alt="The trolley car made Ghent Casino accessible to the residents of downtown New Bern"></p>


<p>Spencer Avenue, the main street in Ghent, is one 
			of the landmark streets in 
			New Bern, with old-fashioned street lamps positioned along a landscaped median 
			separating two lanes of traffic.  Large flowering fruit trees are 
			breathtakingly beautiful in the springtime.</p>
			<p>In recent years Ghent has become a 
			fashionable neighborhood for homeowners looking for a convenient 
			location and a classic homes. The house shown above was built in the 1920's and is a Sears and Roebuck prefab home. There are at least 3 other Sears homes on this block. Did you know that Sears sold over 75,000 home kits from around 1915-1945.</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="../images/Homes-New-Bern-1.jpg" width="492" height="368" alt="After 100  plus years Ghent is still one of New Bern's favorite neighborhoods." title="Ghent is a great place to call home."></p> 
			
			
			<p>
			Ghent is close to one of the area&#39;s nicest amenities, the new YMCA, which 
			includes a Jr. Olympic-sized swimming pool, a gymnasium, weight rooms 
	        a racquetball court and much more. They also offers day care and 
			supervised exercise 
			classes. Gent is also fortunate to be situated between Fort Totten 
			Park, which has a baseball field with bleachers, swings and other 
			park equipment for children, and the larger 
			Lawson Creek Park, a popular fishing spot with nature trails, boat 
			launches,fishing piers, soccer fields, and picnic tables. Both parks are within walking distance 
			of Ghent. Another nice amenity, it is within walking or biking to the historic downtown New Bern.</p>
			<p>Halloween is a special treat for 
			those living in Ghent. Talk about 
			fun. I think half the folks in New Bern take their kids trick or 
			treating at Ghent as the 
			wide sidewalks and high porches make trick or treating fun again 
			even for adults. The house in the photo below was built by my Aunt and Uncle in the early 1930's and is still a nice home. It was a Sears kit plan.</p>
			<p><img border="o" src="../images/New-Bern-Homes-14.jpg" width="403" height="403" alt="Ghent has quite a few Sears and Roebuck homes" title="Another Sears and Roebuck home on Spencer Avenue"></p>
							<p>Homes here are priced from $135,000-$275,000. Some homes have been 
			renovated but many of the homes will require some upgrading. Ghent is a great place to live. Ask my sister Ruthie,she loves it there. On any given afternoon you will see her and Buddy Luv, her dog, walking the sidewalks chatting to her neighbors.</p>

			<p>Riverside was the first suburb of New Bern and is on the national 
							register of historic places. It is located a few blocks from historic downtown 
							New Bern making it an easy bicycle or walking trip.</p>
							
							<p>Development of the Riverside subdivision began in the 1890s in 
							response to the growth of the lumber industry in New 
							Bern. At one time the 
							lumber business flourished along the Neuse River in 
							the Riverside area. Logs were floated down the Neuse 
							River from far away to the many lumber mills located in 
							Riverside and other areas in New Bern.</p>

							<p>Riverside was originally a mixed-use community of residential 
							buildings and commercial enterprises. People wanted 
							to live close to where they worked. The trolley car 
							in New Bern ran from the end of Spencer Avenue 
							through downtown and then on to the Southside of Riverside. </p>
							<p>In the 50's and 60's commerence in the Riverside are left resulting in a neighborhood 
							in decline.</p>
							<p>
							Fortunately, both the city 
							of New Bern and the Preservation Foundation took measures to restore this once handsome community to its original glory. Many of Riverside&#39;s larger homes were built between 1896 and World War II, so there is a pleasant mix of architectural styles in the neighborhood. On National Avenue, high-peaked, two-story Victorian structures with wrap-around porches and plenty of shade trees are situated away from the road.

	<p>The mighty Neuse River, shown in the above photo, is just minutes from Northwest Creek which flows through the West side of Fairfield Harbour. The FFH inland canals are 6'-7' deep, and allow larger sail or motor boats to safely dock behind waterfront homes. There are approximately 325 waterfront homes in FFH. Many are in the flood zone, so you need an experienced Realtor that has been through many storms to ensure you find the right property.</p>
	
	<p>Sailors and motor boaters love this neighborhood 
	because of its easy access to the Neuse River and the Intra-coastal Waterway. 
	Fairfield Harbour also has 4 marinas with over 450 slips, one indoor and two outdoor pools, nine tennis

	<p> Fairfield Harbour is unusual in that it is a combination of mostly 
	single-family homes, with some condominiums, townhouses and timeshare condos 
	added for good measure. Interior home 
			prices start around $150,000 and waterfront homes will run from $225-$550,000. There are plenty of interior lots available for sale if you would like a custom built home. Waterfront lots are becoming scarce so don't wait if you want to build on the water.</p>

	<p>There are an incredible amount of clubs and

			retirees.</p>
			
			<p>Home sites range from an eighth of an acre to more than a full

			variety of home styles into a delightful community with custom homes and mature landscapeing. I built the

			community.</p>
			
<p>	Greenbrier is essentially built out so there if you want a home here you will

	1250 square foot cluster homes to 4000 square foot custom homes.</p>
	
	<p>The championship 18 hole golf course was designed by Rees Jones. It is a challenge to golfers of all skill levels. The country club also has a swimming pool, tennis courts, and a first class practice

<p>Trent Wood&#39;s is now an incorporated town and has its own Police 
Force. Although only a few miles from 
historic downtown New Bern, Trent Woods was once considered to be out in the country 
and other than a few scattered homes it consisted mostly of small 
farms. Now its assorted neighborhoods contain some of the ritziest 
homes in New Bern. Trent Woods is served by two Elementary Schools 
and both are considered among the districts best.</p>

<p> Trent Wood&#39;s is comprised of numerous 
neighborhoods among them are Manning Park, Holly Hills, Chelsea, Trent 
Shores, Bellfern and Ward Point are on the Trent River. Others, such as Creeks 
Ends and Edgewood, are along Wilson&#39;s Creek. The three Haywood 
Creek subdivisions line the banks of Haywood&#39;s Creek. Waterfront properties in Trent Woods start around $400,000 for a creekfront property to well over $1 million for a home on the Trent River.</p>

<p>Most of the homes in Trent Woods were built in the late 60's,70's, and 80's. Many have been updated but some will require a facelift to bring them into the 21th Century. Because Trent Woods it is such a great location most folks will take the tradeoff of remodeling for the convenience of the location. The lots in Trent Woods are mostly spacious, wooded and impeccably 
landscaped, often with towering trees draped in Spanish moss. If you 
drive through Trent Woods in the spring, you&#39;ll find a stunning display of flowering trees and shrubs.</p>

	1970's. The 
	lots are larger, around 1/2 acre, and the mature yards explode in 
	breathtaking views during the spring as the azaleas and dogwoods show their 
	incredible, albeit short lived, splendor. There are quite a few pecan trees in 
	Forest Hills and as a kid I would get $1 for a large paper grocery bag full. 
	Seemed like a lot of money back then.</p>
	<p>You will find exceptional, in my opinion, real estate values here. Often 
	you can get 2000-2200 heated square feet for under $200,000. Yes the homes are 
	older, but many have been updated. </p>
