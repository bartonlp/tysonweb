<p><u><b>Considering retiring in New Bern?</b></u><p>
Keep scrolling down to find out about the many reasons why that might be a great idea for you.
<br>
Since everyone loves the water, lets start with waterways.
<p><img src="../images/New-Bern-Gazebo.jpg" alt="New Bern is a great retirement area" title="Union Point Park is a great place to take the family." width="228" height="163" align="left">

<p> The Neuse and Trent Rivers converge in historic downtown New Bern. At this point the Neuse River is about 1 mile wide. 3 miles down river the Neuse widens out to 3 miles wide and eventually becomes the widest river in the U.S. The picture on the left  
is the Gazebo located in Union Point Park in historic downtown New Bern. Union Point Park is a wonderful place to walk, launch your boat, fish, crab or just relax. During the warmer months live music can often be heard here.</p>
<p>For more information on the Trent and Neuse Rivers click the links below.</p>

<p>In addition to the Neuse and Trent River there are numerous deep, winding, beautiful fresh water creeks that are great for canoeing, kayaking, fishing, and boating. I know, because I have explored all of them.</p>

 The map above shows 2 other reasons New Bern is rated so highly as a retirement destination. New Bern is only 35 minutes from Atlantic Beach and the Carolina Crystal Coast. The Croatan National Forest is over 150,000 acres and is a great place for fishing, hunting, hiking, and exploring. I live on the Trent River and know the area waterways quite well.

<p><a name="11"><b><h2>Where to Retire
Magazine</h2></a></b></p>
<p>New Bern is featured in the
July-August 2008 Where To Retire Magazine, one of the leading
magazines for retirees that are looking to relocate. The magazine is not
available online and the following information is quoted from the
article.</p>
<p>When Dave and Barb Rohrbach
retired in New Bern, they were looking for a comfortable home and an interesting town with history. Comfort was
found in a new home they built in a suburban golf community, but
the history was downtown, where they quickly found themselves
part of an American scene that has been unfolding for almost 300
years. As a volunteer with a dedicated green thumb, Barb helps
ensure that the magnificent gardens of the Tryon Palace continue
to burst into blooms each spring as thousands of visitors come to
visit New Bern.</p>
<p>Barb 57, and Dave, 61, who lived in Manchester CT, investigated several retirement locales in
Florida and the Carolinas before stumbling on<b> New Bern</b>
during a trip in August 2002. At the suggestion of a friend they
had gone to look at Wilmington, NC, and as they returned they
discovered <b>New Bern</b> resting picturesquely on the Neuse and
Trent Rivers, its downtown church steeples visible from the
bridge on highway 70.</p>
<p>The sight prompted an
overnight stop, a spontaneous act that changed their lives.
Congenial, friendly people and the charm of <b>New Bern&#39;s</b>
colonial character quickly won them over. In 2003 they bought a
home in the suburban Taberna community.</p>
<p>Their quiet rural setting is
only 10 minutes from downtown New Bern, where three historic
districts boast Georgian, neoclassical, federal, and Victorian
architecture. Early statesmen, artisans, and business pioneers
lived here, and many of the homes in New Bern have been restored as
offices, restaurants, and shops.</p>
<p>On the corner of Pollock and
Middle Streets in historic downtown New Bern is the pharmacy once
owned by Caleb Bradham. Here Barb greets customers with, welcome
to the birthplace of Pepsi. While growing flowers at Tryon Palace
is her volunteer job, Barb works twice a week as a paid
&quot;soda jerk&quot; in the restored pharmacy where Brad&#39;s
drink later renamed Pepsi-Cola was invented.</p>
<p>It&#39;s such a great downtown, Barb
reflects from behind the old-fashioned soda fountain as tourist
wander in and out. It will be New Bern&#39;s 300th anniversary in
2010, and a great effort is being made to highlight the city with
updated structures and streets.</p>
<p>Dave, who occasionally drops by
the soda fountain for refreshments, is usually busy doing his
volunteer work with habitat for humanity and the chamber of
commerce.</p>
<p>Steeple bells from half a dozen
historic churches announce the hour, and patrons fill friendly
restaurants and shops aptly named Middle Street, which bisects
downtown.</p>
<p>Judy, a former bank
executive in Sarasota, also works part time downtown New Bern as
a loan-servicing agent with the Neuse River Development
Authority, a non-profit lending organization. &quot;There are art
galleries and a civic center and so much theater talent for a
small town. Costumed characters in Colonial garb work the streets
greeting people,&quot; Judy says.</p>
<p>Originally from Maryland, the Bowdle's are
&quot;halfbacks&quot; who decided to move halfway back north to
retire in New Bern's four-season ambience. They wanted
something near the water, and their 3 bedroom home in New
Bern&#39;s upscale Greenbrier neighborhood is 10 minutes from
their 20 foot boat at a small marina on the Neuse River. Golf is
another pastime, and during their breaks from their
&quot;jobettes,&quot; they enjoy the nearby Emerald Golf Course,
where their initiation fee is $900 and monthly dues are $188 for
full golf membership.
