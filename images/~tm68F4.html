<p>The picture shown above was taken about 2 miles down river from Historic 
Downtown New Bern.</p>
<p> The Neuse River is close to 3 miles wide at this point and before it reaches the Pamlico Sound it 
becomes the widest river in the United States.</p>
	<p>With 2 big rivers, miles of deep 
creeks, a mild climate, and 
reasonable property taxes it&#39;s no wonder that we are seeing retiree&#39;s moving to 
New Bern from <i>as far away as Florida and California.</i></p>
			
<p>Waterfront communities on the Neuse in 
and around New Bern, N.C. include Historic Riverside, Historic downtown New Bern, Bridgeton, James City, Old Cherry Point Road, River 
Bluff, Neuse Harbor, Carolina Pines, and the Harlow area,. Neuse River waterfront communities in Pamlico County include 
Minnesot Beach and Oriental.

<p><img border="0" src="../images/jetski-2.jpg" width="282" height="212" alt="New Bern NC has miles of waterfront property" align="left"></p>
<p>New Bern is surrounded by wide rivers and deep navigable creeks. 
Combine this with a close proximity to the Pamlico Sound, the intra-coastal 
waterway, the Atlantic Ocean, and you can see why sailors and power boaters from around 
the country are making New Bern their home. </p>
			
<p>Boaters, sailors, and 
fishermen are moving to New Bern, 
Oriental, and the surrounding areas to enjoy the natural beauty and serenity of the Neuse River; 
and all it&#39;s tributaries. While New Bern has a distinct 4 seasons the 
winters are generally mild and it is not unusual to see fishermen and sailors 
on the water year around.</p>

					<p>The  Trent River, while not as majestic as 
					the Neuse, 
					is better protected from storms and high winds. The deep water near the shore 
					line makes for a better choice for those wanting to dock a boat in their back 
					yard. The calmer waters make recreational boating a favorite 
					pastime. 
					<p><img border="0" src="../images/steve-ski.jpg" width="623" height="351" alt="water sking in New Bern" title="Steve Tyson water sking" align="left"</p>
					Most any sunny day will bring out the water skiers, 
					boogie boarders, jet skiers and bass fishermen. 
					Waterfront Communities in 
					the New Bern N.C. area on the 
					Trent River include Riverbend, Trent Woods, Old Towne, 
					Madame Moore Lane, and the Brice&#39;s Creek, Goose Creek area.

						<p>Look at the picture above and it is easy to see why 
				serious sailors love to live on or near the Neuse River. The Neuse is around 1 mile 
				wide in Historic downtown New Bern. By the time you reach Fairfield Harbour it 
			widens out to 2-3 miles across. Just a little upriver from Fairfield 
			and she is really rocking.</p>
			<p>Across from Oriental is the Adams Creek section of the 
			Intracoastal waterway. A short ride down this section will spill you 
			into the quaint historic town of Beaufort.</p>
