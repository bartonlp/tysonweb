					 <p><b>Fairfield Harbour</b> is the only gated community in the New Bern area and has 24 hour security on duty. Above is a picture of the Security guard house and the fence at the entrance to FFH.</p>

<p>Fairfield Harbour is a very popular area for sailers, power boaters, fishermen and golfers. There is an 18 hole Rees Jones designed golf course located within the community that is currently being managed by Billy Casper Golf Management Company. I have played this coarse many times and consider it one of my favorite layouts. The picture below was taken on the 17 hole which is a short par 3 overlooking Broad Creek. I have fished, skied, and canoed on Broad Creek my entire life. Great fishing and boating.</p>
<p><img src="../images/FFH-Golf-1.jpg" width="600"  alt="Fairfield Harbour is a gated community" title="Fairfield Harbour Golf Coarse" border="0" /></p>	
	
<p>There are some 200 waterfront homes in FFH ranging in price from $200,000 to $550,000. In addition there are still a few waterfront lots for sale ranging in price from $90,000-$150,000. Most of the waterfront homes are on protected deep water canals. The canals, <i>see picture below</i>, connect to Northwest Creek and then to the Neuse River.</p> 

 <p><img src="../images/FFH-2.jpg" width="642" width="426" alt="Fairfield Harbour has a deep water inner-canal system" title="Gated Communities with plenty of waterfront homes" border="0" /></p>

<p>It only takes a few minutes to get to the mighty Neuse River from the inner-canals and once you reach the river you are in  big water. The picture shown below was taken where Northwest Creek enters the Neuse River. About 15 miles from this point the river widens out to about 5 miles wide.</p>

<p><img src="../images/Deep-Water.jpg" width="635" width="422" alt="Gated Community, protected waters" title="Fishing, Boating,Sailing" border="0" /></p>

<p>For those that do not live on the water, Fairfield is home to 4 marinas. Blackbeards is a private Marina for sail boats only. Northwest Creek Marina has over 270 slips and is considered one of the best protected marinas in the area. Boating and sailing are great in this area. The river is 2-3 miles wide here and the intercoastal waterway and the Pamlico Sound are 15 miles or so down river. Sailing, boating, skiing, jet skiing, fishing and Kayaking are all popular sports in Fairfield Harbour.</p>

<p>Fairfield has perhaps 200 homes on navigable waters that vary in cost from $200,000 to $500,000.

					<p>Here's how it works: You input your original mortgage balance, the original term and interest rate. Then figure out how many month's of payments you've already made. Finally, decide how soon you'd like to have your mortgage paid off. For example, a couple in their 40's may decide that they'd like to pay off the 30-year loan they took out last year in 20 years. They input the particulars of their current loan, put in a new term of 20 years, and the Early Payoff Calculator determines how much extra they need to pay each month to make that happen. </p>
