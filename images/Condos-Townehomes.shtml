<h2>What is a Condo?</h2>
<p>Condo property owners own the inside of their units. They do not own the land under their unit, nor any ground outside of the unit. Every condo development has common areas such as recreation areas, sidewalks, parking lots, etc. Condo owners share ownership of the common areas with other owners. Typically the owners pay dues to a homeowners association to cover the costs of maintaining the common areas. They also may pay other expenses such as management fees, Liability insurance on common areas, and taxes. Many condos also have an account set up to cover certain exterior maintenance.</p>

<h2>What is a Townhome?</h2>

<p>Townhouse owners own the complete unit, including
exterior surfaces and the land on which the unit is built. Usually there is some land outside of the unit that is also deeded with the property. Usually there is an HOA that will collect dues from each homeowner and pay any expenses that are common to all owners. Also, like condos, Many townhomes also have an account set up to cover certain exterior maintenance.</p>

<p>Both condos and townhouse developments have common areas of the property such as recreation areas,
sidewalks, parking lots, etc.). Condo owners share
ownership of the common areas with other owners,
while common areas in townhouse developments are
usually owned by the homeowners association for the
benefit and use of unit owners. Either way, owners
typically pay dues to a homeowners association to
cover the costs of maintaining the common areas, as
well as other common area expenses such as insurance, taxes, lawn maintenance.</p> 

<p>It is important for you to do your due dilligense on the restrictive covenants, bylaws, etc. that pertain to an HOA before buying. It is also a good idea to talk to the HOA president and manager and ask them questions about the HOA.</p>
