<p>Dear Jana and Steve</p>
<p>I wanted to thank you for all your work in 
helping us find our house. We are still trying to get settled in.<br>We
welcomed Elizabeth to our family on June 26th, two days before 
we moved. I would like to invite you and Steve anytime to stop 
by and take a look at the kitchen now that it has been opened 
up. We look forward to seeing you again.</p>

<p>We have only words of praise to describe our 
experience with Steve and Jana Tyson of The Tyson Group in New Bern. We were initially charmed by New Bern during 
our first visit to the area, but had no idea where to start 
looking for a home or the benefits and drawbacks of each 
area. Luckily, we contacted the Tyson Group and asked a few 
questions. During each succeeding trip to New Bern over the 
next eighteen months, Steve and Jana would patiently take us on 
tours of the local area and help us learn about the many 
different options available. We finally found just the house 
that we had envisioned and are delighted with our new home.
During our previous house-buying experiences, the house closing 
ended the willingness of a real estate agency to extend advice 
and assistance – that was not the case with the Tyson Group.
Steve and Jana provided invaluable help and advice to us
after closing and helped make our transition to our New Bern 
home as smooth as possible. Throughout our process, the Tyson 
Group was consistently friendly, helpful, and willing to go a 
step beyond” what we have previously experienced from real 
estate professionals.</p>

<p>I have known Steve Tyson for over 30 years so when I decided to 
sell a piece of commercial property I already knew who to list with. In the midst
of the worst recession since the depression he got it sold in less than 2 
months. Thank you Steve for a job well done. I would recommend you to anyone.</p>

<p>We visited New Bern for the

contract. They more than met our expectations.</p>

for me.</p>

<p><b>Tony and Linda Poletto</b></p>
<p>Being that we live in Pennsylvania, we knew that it could be difficult to find the right realtor to sell our New Bern, NC lot.
We had a couple of recommendations about other groups, but there was never any call back or follow up.
One day we contacted the Tyson Group after receiving their postcard in the mail, and that was it.
After one phone call, we knew we found the right people to help us.
We spoke to Steve many times during the listing and sale process.
He made every step so easy and simple.
We did not have to make a special trip to NC - everything was handled quickly, easily and professionally.
We highly recommend Steve Tyson and the entire Tyson Group.  We will definitely use them when it is time for us to move to New Bern.

<p>I moved to New Bern from

process of building my own home.</p>

contract they stayed on top of things and made sure the 
closing went smooth.</p>
